# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
### With the skills that were gained from Python and Pandas, the project consisted of me creating a summary data frame off the ride sharing data by city type. Another data that had to be created was a multiple line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. 
## Results
For the analysis, merging of data was needed in order to create the data chart. The first image is data gathered from different areas of the city and getting a total of the rides, drivers, and fares, along with the averages. According to the chart, it reveals that drivers in urban cities have a lower average of fares compared to rural and suburban, but more drivers in the urban cities. In the urban cities, there are 13x more rides compared to the rural.  As for average fare per ride, it is lower in urban areas by 1.4.

For the multiple line plot chart, it shows the total weekly of fares for each type of city. The yellow line represents the urban cities and how the total fares in urban cities are much higher than in the rural and suburban areas. The blue represents rural, and the red line represents suburban areas.

## Summary
After creating datasets and a multiple line plot chart, overall the rural cities are able to bring in more income even if the urban cities make more revenue. Urban cities should improve more on the driver rides such as reduce the drivers in urban cities because its statistics are much higher than in rural and suburban areas.
